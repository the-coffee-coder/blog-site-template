Converted HTML coded blog site template based on Bootstrap 4 to a custom Wordpress Theme.  Demonstrates that I could take a clients static site and keep it's style while giving them the ability to manage in a Content Management System(CMS), i.e. Wordpress.

This site was created as a practice exercise with instruction from freecodecamp.org's YoutTube tutorial presented by Andrew Wilson.
